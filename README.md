# Endless Rusting

## About
Endless Rusting was origionaly made because I wanted to try learn java, but now I'm continuing to work on it because I'm finding it fun. The mod is about fleshing out the lore of PTER, and adding new mechanics which fit with vanilla.

## V7 Compatability
I've got plans for full v7 compatability, though I'm not sure whats to come. Units are now compatable, and so is the dialog, but I've got to wait and see if everything works for the next BE build.

## Compiling

### Required applications
- JDK 8.

### Windows

Plain Jar: gradlew build
Dexify Plain Jar: gradlew dexify
Build Plain & Dexify Jar: gradlew buildDex

Note: Preferably use the plain jar for windows. If you're compiling for an android user, build the dexed jar instead. Dexed jars tend to be much larger, and are unescecary if you can compile a plain jar.

### Desktop/Mac

Plain Jar: ./gradlew build
Dexify Plain Jar: ./gradlew dexify
Build Plain & Dexify Jar: ./gradlew buildDex

Note: Preferably use the plain jar for windows. If you're compiling for an android user, build the dexed jar instead. Dexed jars tend to be much larger, and are unescecary if you can compile a plain jar.


## Mechanics

### Researchable Blocks ingame
This one's a big one. Certain blocks now require both researching in the Tech tree (In campaign) and researching ingame to use. This will Stop you from simply rushing down the new Technology. To compensate though, the researchable blocks are stronger than their vanilla counterparts, or feature some new mechanic. Most research costs are below a thousand of one materiel, though they tend to be mixed depending on the block's usage and practical applications.

### Pulse
A weird substance which is simulated by mindustry, and is colletable from the air.
Used in various tech, such as defense, production and support

### Mount Abiities
Units can have abilities which draw as though they are weapons. Various mounts can do difrent things such as charging up building, or healing units.
At the moment, theres only one unit which is planed to have these, with two types of mounts and no weapons.

### Smart AI
As it turns out, having untis which can do various tasks isn't to powerfull. The new suport units in this mod are able to
- Mine resources and bring them abck to the core
- Defend themselves or other units
- Track down damaged allies and heal them
- Flee back to repair points or cores
- Prioritize targets next to damaged allies

### Damaging Weather
Weather which can rain bullets from the sky has been added! I'm working to make the impact of the weather on gameplay noticible enough that it becomes something that the player should think about, but not be the entire focus of their time spent in the storm.

### Pirmitive Logic Systems
Ever wanted to make a dnace pad without much logic? Well now you... kind of can.
Basic logic transfers 4 pieces of information like normal logic systems, only blocks read the information in a certain way!
You will have to reformat the information into a readable form for the blocks to do what you expect them to, or mess around with unintentional interactions between sender and reciever.

## New Status Effects

### Spreading Status Effects
The more the merrier, untill theres a ton of infected units with no way to heal them all. Spreading status effects tend to be applied for longer, do less damage and tend to have some quirk that affects the unit directly.

### Crystal status effects
Slows the unit down drasticaly, and draws a spiky crystal around it. That's about it.

### Custom status effects
Status effects that have special efefcts like no other! Find out mroe about them in their descriptions, these special snowflakes will soon get their own title.

## Maps in cannonical order

### Incipiens Grounds

Intro: 
> Silenced by your landing, the perfect palce to settle down. Collect copper and lead. Disarm active traps. Fend off the invaders.
They were wrong to come and ruin the peace. It was going to be just you. A flooded landscape, which was home to some, but that was awhile ago.
Theres an abundance of resources here, and machiens which were assumed to be inactive. The natives must have been invadeed often, as you can see some still active landmines, or not because they're hidden untill they activate. So much for minesweeping. You can however use them against attackers to hold off early waves ot leave room for mistakes.

Waves: 6 Posible spawn locations out of them two will be chosen. This might seem anoying, but remember, this is only the spawn location! The opposition are forced into one of two paths, one being longer if you force them into it.
![pathes diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73347888/124107778-ec5fe300-daa8-11eb-83bd-f3f1475e9e68.png)

With multiple guardian waves, during the cannonical 23 waves, you might want to get ready for the native's wrath, as after wave 5 you'll see abandoned suport units fending off you, the invader trying to protect their old home. After wave 20, you'll see a difficulty spike, as extra Maces spawn in, alongside fast, suport units which heal others, chase down units and have bouncing bullets which also home in on their targets. Thought that the starting sector was suposed to go easy on you? Well, kinda. Theres a lil trick you can do, where you bait these advanced suport untis into air defense, them being to focused on you to notice that they're dying quickly. This little trick can help clear out the guardians quickly, and is extremely helpfull during the last 3 waves. Air units only spawn with guardians, which may be a good or bad thing depending on whether you've prepeared for being rushed down or not.

Difficulty: Peaceful/Easy

### Pailean Coridors
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73347888/124103849-07305880-daa5-11eb-8b62-feb2c4df92a5.png)

Intro: A somewhat peacfull basin, with water seeping in. Some buildings are intact from an age of technological advancement. Why they're in ruin, nobody knows. Theres exposed titanium, coal, copper, lead and scrap here. Before any opposition arrives, use the exposed minerals and resources to defend yourselves, as the coridors will be peacefull no more.

Waves: Two spawnpoints, and an ever growing amount of ground units means that you'll want to focus on artillary and avoid focusing to much on the encroaching air forces, especialy since they arrive much later. Theres 45 waves in the cannon appearence of the opposition, and a guardian wave, containing a t4 from vanilla.

Difficulty: Easy/Medium

### Abysal Crevasse

Intro: An almost infected looking mountainside map, with geodes full of a volatile materiel. The walls are full of shards of this, hwoever the geodes hold the only harvestable sources of this previus comodity, until we learn how to extract this crystal from the walls. The water here is filled with dust from the crystal, having slowly sept into the water after initialy being released. Similar machines to the ones seen in Pailean Coridors are present here, only there seems to be something new...

Asside from the crystals, resources are somewhat scarce here, featuring a small amount of titanium veins in particular. Copper and lead however are not a problem, as our miners know how to get the msot out of the scarce veins. Coal and sand are both present here, allowing us to make silicon for advanced electronics and minning drones. We can also use the infected water, as the dust poses to threat to our machinary once pumped out and sepparated from the water.

Waves: Two spawnpoints, with an ever growing amount of spawned low tier units and multiple guardian waves. Strap yourself in. Theres 38 waves in the cannon appearence of the opposition. Thankfully, theres a 3-9 wave period where enemies sustain heavy enough damage that they die before reaching our core. The ruins sure contain some helpfull machines, including ones which can shoot! Don't stay to long, as theres a guardian on wave 66 which likes to ruin things. All guardians seem to be followed by a miniwave of units, posibly protecting them. Tankfully, the guardian which appears before the ending isn't that strong.

Difficulty Meduim/Hard
